Data Analysis of Top Grossing Nollywood Music
Most of us born in Nigeria grew up watching Nollywood as a kid. The Cinema industry in Nigeria is commonly referred to as Nollywood. Nollywood is the largest movie industry globally in terms of output and is the third-largest in terms of overall revenues generated. A $100 million mark for a movie released domestically in Hollywood is often celebrated. Similarly, a ₦100 million mark in Nigeria is also seen as a monumental box office feat for all releases.

One of the past biggest challenges of the Nollywood industry was getting accurate data as the industry’s structure slack in that area. But recently, things have improved, with most of its movies getting featured on Netflix.

The data provided on the Wikipedia page shows that the highest-grossing Nigerian films of all time in Nigerian cinemas from 2008 is a descending order table list of 100 movies with their respective producers and domestic gross.

Here is the step-by-step approach I used to analyse the data using the Pandas library on Python.
